### CPSC 120

* lab 3
	
	The second part of lab 3 was very interesting to me as there was a lot of math involved 
	that made it pretty complex to understand for me. The code was supposed to find the
	differences in days between 2 dates, given a day, month, and year. This project made me
	realize the importance of functions, as it would be inefficient to write the formula
	every single time we were going to use it, and it helped with debugging the program
	because when the program didn't output the expected results, I knew it was probably 
	something to do with the formula.

* lab 8
	The second part of lab 8 was very fun because the code made a pretty cool pattern
	in the terminal. This lab helped me visualize loops and it's different types such as
	outer loops and inner loops. The pattern looked like a pyramid which made it satisfying
	when me and my partner got it all correct. This lab was just satisfying in general
	and helped me visualize the basics of loops.

* lab 9
	The first part of lab 9 had a lot going on, but it made me and my partner use input
	and output files, which I was not familiar with at first. From this lab, I was able
	I was able to read words from a file, and then put those words into a vector. This
	helped me understand what ifstream did. This lab was a great way for me to work with
	input files for a task that would take so long to do manually, which is to find misspelled
	words by seeing if the word in a document has the same spelling as the word in the dictionary.
